### Setup

*.env requirements*
- n/a

### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

- pip install pytest
- python3 game.py

### How to use your library (where applicable)

- not applicable

### Tests

- Tests are located in the tests directory --> tests/version_1 , version_2 , version_3
- Still passing version_1 tests
- Misunderstood that the version_2 and version_3 tests would check for verbatim responses. Did not see some other tests.
- Built code to address feature requirements of lab, and to resemble .txt files, but did not build code to pass tests.
- Will need to return to this lab and refactor
